lh - Linux House control

Uses an avrow device connected to /dev/ttyUSB0

export AVROW=/dev/ttyUSB0

Start with 
	./eventloop <$AVROW

Serial device setting
stty -F$AVROW 19200 raw -crtscts cs8 -cstopb -echo

Commands
get addr - returns status 0 if device is set, 1 otherwise
set addr value - sets device at addr to value that has value 0 or 1

to catch change events, create an executable file named device-change-addr where addr is the address of the device to listen to.
On a device value change, the file is executed as
	device-change-addr evtype addr value time
The args are
	evtype - arr or change
	addr - the address of the device (see addr)
	value - 0 for off or 1 for on
	time - a two digit hex number for the time at the event. The time is in a unit faster than seconds and used for debugging

Addresses
The addresses are 1-wire addresses for normal 1-wire devices. For a type 47 device the adress is of the form 
owaddr-b where owaddr is the 1-wire device address and b is a bit number in the device from 0 to 4.
